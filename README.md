###### â€» PoR is a new open blockchain consensus algorithm and is still theoretical.<br/><br/>I hope this algorithm will be discussed and improved with the people who study and develop the blockchain.<br/>As a mathematically provable algorithm based on computational complexity theory, there is also a need to help those who can deal with nonlinear values well.<br/><br/>Except for some of the relational formulas, the idea is over and the technical documentation was written once.<br/>However, it is Korean.

# PoR ( Proof of Relevancy )

### Blockchain Consensus Algorithm determined by Relevancy

PoR is a blockchain consensus algorithm that the next block is determined by relevancy.
The relevancy is obtained from the proprietary information of each block between adjacent blocks.
The relevancy can also be created from the work of PoW or the stake of PoS.
In this document, the asymmetric key pair of each block used to generate the signature is also used as the proprietary information.

It uses a hash chain of Bitcoin, but has a double chain structure such as Bitcoin-NG.
There are a key block chain and an authentication block chain linked each other.
In the key block chain, a candidate that can generate an authentication through consensus is registered.
In the authentication block chain, the authentication for a ledger is registered.
With the use of a double chain, the registered candidate can generate a real authentication after a very long time and there is also competition at that time.

Relevancy is used for competition to be registered as a candidate to generate an authentication.
Reverse relevancy is used for competition to create real authentication.
Both competing situations are competition for time based on relevancy and they are all for personal benefit.
This prevents problems such as 'nothing at stake'.

It is not the computational complexity that simply solves the hash, but there are numerical parts related to the operation of the algorithm such as many candidate blocks or very large threshold value, and they are all designed based on computational complexity theory.
As a result, all attacks on the algorithm are probabilistically impossible.

Due to the use of the double chain with attributes such as relevancy, reverse relevancy, and the threshold value for generating authentication block, the authentication for the ledger operates deterministically.
Attacks such as double spending or finney attack do not occur because authentication to the ledger is deterministic.

Due to the use of proprietary information, it is more resistant than bitcoin against 51% attack and localization problems.
High-speed processing is possible enough to generate each authentication block for the unit ledgers without the use of merkle tree depending on the size of the network.
There may be one reward for participation of a majority of legitimate users, but there are no rewards for the functional behavior of the algorithm.

## Relevancy and Consensus Mechanism

### Relevancy Formula

![relevancyFormula](relevancyFormula.png?raw=true "relevancyFormula")
```
r      : relevancy
c      : number of following blocks including the target block ( c > 0 )
n      : sequence number of candidate blocks starting with 0 ( n < c )
m of n : number of consecutive bits with the same value as the previous hash value starting from the beginning
a      : relevancy factor ( a > 1 )
```
